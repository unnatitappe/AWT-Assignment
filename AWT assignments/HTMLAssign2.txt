        Within a matter of two days, India lost two of its most distinguished and charismatic stars, Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor.
        The sudden news of their passing away left everyone in a state of shock.
        With widespread outpour of grief across social media, we also saw various theories that tried to link the two stars, 
        trying to make sense of their demise so close to each other.“Many people would have wanted to say goodbye, 
        but this is how Irrfan would have wanted it," said Vishal Bhardwaj, a director who attended the funeral, 
        which was held on Wednesday. “He never made a show about anything. Success never changed him.’’ The two stars were so different.
        Mr. Khan, who was featured as a police inspector in the hit “Slumdog Millionaire,” was an actor’s actor. Known for his intensity,
        studiousness and approachability, he came from humble roots. His father sold tires. 
        He was not considered as classically handsome as a typical movie star, and many Indians felt an affinity with him 
        — a fine actor (he has been described as India’s Philip Seymour Hoffman) who was also a regular guy. 
        Film directors said Mr. Khan reliably undersold himself, asking for less money for parts than he could have commanded.
        And to help out his film making friends, he sometimes took on roles that other actors avoided.</p></div>

            He gravitated toward Shakespeare, starring in “Maqbool,” a retelling of “Macbeth," and playing a ghostlike figure, 
            a prisoner who had survived a notorious torture chamber, in “Haider,” a film inspired by “Hamlet” but set in Kashmir.
            Many of his friends, and his fans, feel that destiny cheated him, plucking away his life at a relatively young age 
            as he was reaching the peak of his career after decades of working his way up. “He was perhaps one of the best actors we had,” 
            said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a filmmaker who runs a film preservation foundation. “But beyond that, he was a lovely person.” 
            “Just look at the posts on social media,” Mr. Dungarpur said. “These are not fan photographs. 
            They are people who had worked with Irrfan, who had done something with Irrfan,
            who connected with Irrfan in a very different way than that of most superstars.”
            Mr.Khan grew up in a Muslim family and was laid to rest in a Muslim graveyard. 
            In recent years, the divide between India’s Muslim minority and its Hindu majority has widened and grown more treacherous.</p></div>
